This SSO Application implemented using Oauth2.0 tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

[[overview-terminology]]
== Terminology

There are two types of token are provided by our SSO Application.
access_token is responsible for accessing your resources from the resource server. 
This token usually has a little validity time. You can access your data with this token a certain time before it get’s expired. 
So after it expires, you need to request Authorization server for a new access_token with your refresh token, client id, and client secret, so that you don’t need to send user credentials again and again. 
Refresh token has more validation time than Access Token. Typically 7-90 days.

----
Note :

When expires_in is 0 that means this access token is expired and then you have to make 
the call again to get the access token.

{
  "access_token" : "some access token",
  "token_type" : "bearer",
  "refresh_token" : "original refresh token of the request",
  "expires_in" : 0,
  "scope" : "read write"
}


this will be send by when any resource end point is accessed

e.g <base_url>/v1/company/example-company-id/users

{ 
	"error":"invalid_token",
	"error_description":"Access token expired: some-access-token-value"
